    <h2>On Coolness</h2>
    <h3 style="font-weight: normal; font-family:times new roman">On 'coolness', Jan 29, 2022</h3>
    <p style="font-family: times new roman">"When we started GFB one year ago, this was the first topic that came to mind. One year later I'm finally getting around to writing the article. In the past few years it seems, people have gotten confused whether to champion earnestness or irony. In the pursuit of staying cool, its hard to tell whether to care about things a lot or not care about them at all. You want to seem like you don't care but of course the only way to actually not care is to actually not care. Authenticity is like the potion in the cave horcrux scene from Harry Potter 6. You can't scoop it up unless you actually plan on drinking it.
    </p> 

    authenticity+scarcity=coolness

    <p>
    	So I can wear a Wrangler shirt with snaps if I want to. But if someone meets me, they aren't going to think I've ever set foot on a ranch. I'm not fooling anyone. But, when a less extreme example comes along, say being into running, the lines get blurry. A lot of people can be into running. Its an easy activity that you need no other equipment other than shoes to participate in. So if you're actually a runner who owns an old pair of Asics and wears them on a day to day basis that's cool. But if you're simply aware of Outdoor Voices and buy their Hokas to never run in them thats not really that cool. Being interested in something, like running, is generally seen as cool, but being disinterested in how you present it is even cooler. This is the line that all aspiriring cool people have to tow. Ultimitely, everyone wants to have a hobby that few others do that they can flex. Its scarcity and authenticity at work along with a cousin of authenticity: function.
    <p/>

    	function(authenticity+scarcity)= coolness

   <p>
   	Before things become cool they have to be useful. Take blue jeans for example. In the 1870s, a German immigrant named Levi Strauss began to sell denim pants held together by rivets to settlers, workers, farmers and miners in the American West. Now, jeans are maybe the garment most associated with cool people in the past 100 years. The rule holds up for more abstract situations too. A t-shirt with a brand on it might be cool because it communicates who a business is, but a t-shirt with art on it usually isn't. A t-shirt from your local Italian deli that might even have a phone number on it? That's cool. A t-shirt with an illustration of an owl on it? Uhhhh. Fashion isn't cool. Art isn't cool. Its something else. This brings me to the topic of brands. Brands are a shortcut to coolness.
   </p>
   <p>
   	Remember when we were talking about scarcity? We said that unique hobbies allowed for the authenticity required to be cool. In lieu of these hobbies however, aspiring cool people can tap into brands. I mentioned a few brand names earlier. Brands act very much the same way as hobbies; they offer a group you can siphon identity out of because they are always associated with a hobby or subculture. Sometimes you're actually associated with the same thing a brand is. Most of the time you're not. If a brand, or usually a specific product of the brand, gets too big though, then its uncool (Supreme box logo stuff, Arc'teryx jackets) like a star that burns too bright and runs out of fuel. Slow growth is always the best kind of growth. The same is true for hobbies and subcultures to a lesser degree, think snowboarding in the early 2000s or climbing/bouldering today. This might be sound like an obvious observation but its important to understanding phases of popularity. What makes these things uncool isn't the things themselves (Arc'teryx is an actual technical outdoor brand, people are actually into climbing) but the people who co-opt them for the reason of being cool. Authenticity is the only correct motive for dressing how you dress.

 		People aren't dumb. They understand this. But people take the path of least resistence to solve this problem. Deflect the blame elsewhere. Write it off as a joke. The opposite of earnestness is irony and sarcasm. Its such an easy fix. 'Yeah I'm wearing this retro Alan Jackson shirt,' an irony user might say, 'but I would never acually listen to <i>country music.</i>' Irony allows people to wear things they don't actually associate with and still get away with being considered cool. This happens a lot with style conscious people (like Throwing Fits people) because they are a largely homogenous group. There are only so many places to pull authenticity from in a homogenous group and, in order to innovate, authenticity needs to be invented. This frequently leads to sarcasm and irony.
 	</p>
 	<p>
 		Irony is mostly a pretty stupid position to take. The problem is, a lot of time its conflated with self awareness. The same holds true for the desire to be too self aware. Think, 'I'm quirky!'. People see through inauthenticity either way. Its important to do things because you actually like them, and if you do actually like them there's no reason to be ashamed of it. This concept is seen in music taste a lot. People increasingly seem to be less embarassed about having good music taste, because most people listen to music to make themselves feel something and music listening is largely a solo activity today. People find the music that resonates with them and listen to that a lot. It contriubutes to the problem of people listnening to new music less than ever before, which is its own essay. But this trend makes you look at the music taste of someone like Alex Delany and think, something's up here. Earnestness is cool.

   <p>I'm sure at this point your are asking yourself, 'Why is coolness important? It sure sounds like a lot of time, money and energy that could be better placed somewhere else!' Well you'd be right. You can have a successful and I would say even more fulfilling life if you didn't care about being cool. Coolness at its core is signaling, 'I know what's going on.' Dress well if you want to dress well. But dress well for your own sake. Don't overthink it.
