		You Should Be Watching Baseball (And Here's Why)
  </div>
    <p>Baseball gets a bad rap. It's the sport that people love to hate. "It's so boring!" "I like going to games, but I could never watch it otherwise," "I'd rather download TikTok than watch one second of baseball," people quip. Well these people are wrong. Baseball is one of the most interesting cultural institutions America has ever produced and somehow it's dipped below the radar in the past 15 years or so. I used to fall into the immovable slog of general thought on baseball. I used to say it was boring without really thinking critically about my reasoning. It was simply just the easier thing to say. Now I'm going to explain why.</p>
