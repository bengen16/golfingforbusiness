		<h1><em>You've Got Mail</em> is the Pinnacle of Underrated Graphic Design</h1>
    <p>I'll say it. I'm something of a rom-com addict. In the last couple years I’ve developed a deep appreciation for these films, which indisputably take the crown as the ultimate escapist genre. Perhaps some of you are familiar with the name Nora Epron. Perhaps even more of you are familiar with her work which includes genre pillars, pantheon-worthy greats, like When Harry Met Sally, and Sleepless in Seattle.</p> 

    <p>But we’re not here to talk about those movies. We’re here to talk about a movie whose screenplay Ephron clearly, and could only have been written during a 3-week period sometime in June, 1997. You’ve Got Mail is a looking glass into a very specific period of recent history, a time when using the internet was gimicky (edit or was like using a toaster), and Meg Ryan’s small independent kids bookstore was more worried about the big-box Barnes and Noble parody, run by Tom Hanks, then they are about a certain Jeff’s 4 year old internet startup. Oh, and everybody loves Starbucks.</p>

    <p>Seattle, however, is not the setting of You’ve Got Mail. An idyllic New York City plays host to our protagonists of late 90s yore. Being a recent HBO Max subscriber, off the mooching of my family, You’ve Got Mail was a recent viewing of mine. Among the seasonal NYC backdrop, the fascinating glimpse into the psyche of 1998, and Meg Ryan’s undeniable magnetism, what struck me most on my inaugural watch was the exceptional graphic design, and for a movie no less.</p>

    <p>The title sequence starts us off with an interesting, non-rom-com-esque low poly computer animated Manhattan that certainly doesn’t do the job of getting you in the mood to watch a “will they won’t they” love story. But, when Barnes and Noble <em>-er-</em> I mean Fox Books starts renovating the block for their new mega store, I was dumbfounded. Wow, that wall looks like it could have been designed yesterday by a Brooklyn based lunch spot that makes more money selling <a href="https://ohnotype.co/fonts/eckmannpsych">Eckmannpsych</a> clad merch online than it does actually serving food.</p>
